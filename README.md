# Stock-Market-Prediction
Artificial Intelligence, which consists of making computers perform tasks that normally require human 
intelligence, is currently the dominant trend in scientific research.  
This project aims to build a model using python libraries to predict future stock market closing values. 
The recent trend in stock market prediction technologies is the use of machine learning which makes 
predictions based on the values of current stock market indices by training on their previous values. 
LSTM networks are an extension of recurrent neural networks (RNNs) mainly introduced to handle 
situations where RNNs fail.  
1.It fails to store information for a long period of time. At times, a reference to certain information 
stored quite a long time ago is required to predict the current output. But RNNs are incapable of 
handling such “long-term dependencies”. 
2.There is no finer control over which part of the context needs to be carried forward and how much of 
the past needs to be ‘forgotten’.  
3.Other issues with RNNs are exploding and vanishing gradients which occur during the training 
process of a network through backtracking.
